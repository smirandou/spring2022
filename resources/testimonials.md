This class is extremely useful for many CSC courses at URI. This class might be your first introduction to GitHub, which is extremely important when working in team projects. I would recommend keeping up with your work. This class has rolling deadlines and often work slips by without realizing how mush is piling up. Try setting a strict schedule for yourself and KEEP TO IT. Enjoy the class! It is great practice for 411 and a good introduction onto hardware.
